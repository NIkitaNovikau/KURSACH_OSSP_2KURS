This repository provides code on the topic "Data exchange program over Ethernet(mac 2 mac)".

To do this job, you will need an Ethernet adapter and a twisted pair.I was running a program in Java using IDEA, as well as the swing library for some kind of window application, since it was boring for me to do everything in the console.

Problems :
*The explanatory note was made absolutely not according to GOST standards

*There are some problems in the code with closing threads on program termination

*My code, let's say, very much complies with the POSIX standard

*Also, errors occur during several visits to back to main
